# Minecraft-Server
Minecraft Server for me and my friends.
This repository is for storing backups of the server.
The bash script "startmcserver" starts the server and the shell script "backupmcserver.sh" pushes the latest changes to this repo. 
This runs on a desktop running Ubuntu Server. I have a cron job that runs the backup script at 3 PM GMT(8 AM Pacific Daylight Time).
